## Overview
[joola.io][22] is a distributed data processing and visualization framework. The framework is designed as an end-to-end
solution for data analytics. The framework connects to your databases and using a JSON based mapping of dimensions and
metrics, it exposes a RESTful API for querying the data. The Client SDK communicates with the engine to display,
visualize and provide insight into the data. Developers can extend the framework in many ways, add data connectors,
authentication plugins, visualizations and more.

To learn more about the framework architecture, see our [documentation site][1].

## The Analytics Website
joola.io.analytics is a full implementation of an HTML5 analytics site consuming data from [joola.io.engine][9].
 The site uses [joola.io.sdk][11] to communicate with the engine and draw SVG visualizations, tables, metrics boxes and more.

Forking this repository is a quick way to start your own analytics website, tailored to your needs.

### Installing
```bash
$ npm install joola.io.analytics
```

#### Using
```bash
$ npm start

# point your browser to http://localhost:40002
```
